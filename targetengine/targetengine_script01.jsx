// what is the InDesign targetengine ?// if you want to store something e.g. a value or a string// you can define a targetsession with a specific name of you choice// this session will exist until you close InDesign// use this only if you know for shure what you are doing// for example run thisscript in InDesign:/*    #targetengine "session01"    var myValue = 0;    alert(myValue);    myValue++;*///than this one;/*    #targetengine "session01"    alert(myValue);*/// InDesign will alert 0 at first as declared// the second script will alert 1// because myValue was stored by the targetengine "session1"// and got incremented at the end of script one// with now targetengine declared InDesign will create at launch his own engine// and destroy that after the script execution// this is "garbage collection"#targetengine "session01"var myValue = 0;alert(myValue);myValue++;
